# Data Structures - University Project

## Project 1 - Linked List vs Dynamic Array

In this project, I implemented my own linked list and tested basic methods such as searching, inserting, and removing elements. 
The linked list was implemented in C++.

## Project 2 - Priority Queue

Implementation of Priority Queue using linked list in C++. The project includes basic operations on the Priority Queue.

## Project 3 - Hash Table

This project involved implementing and comparing the efficiency of different collision resolution techniques for a Hash Table in C++.

The collision resolution techniques implemented were:
* Separate Chaining
* Open Addressing
* Cuckoo Hashing
